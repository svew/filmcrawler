Filmcrawler is a desktop app which statistically analyzes your movie preferences.
It extracts data from imdb.com, then asks you questions about what movies you've
seen, what movies you want to see, and how you would rate certain movies. Using
this data, it determines who are your favorite actors, directors, boom mic guys, etc.
You can also browse your ecosystem of movies and people, and categorize them 
into lists.
